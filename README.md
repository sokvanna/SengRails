SengRails
=========

Plan:

I think I want to build a E-commerce application/site

Features:

Users can Login and add products

Products will get displayed on products page

Allow users to browse through different product categories

Usual navigation (about, shop, contact, news/latest)

Add to cart

Checkout (if I make it that far)

Breakdown:

Need to create admin login system

Have a database to store the prodcts with name, skus, etc.

Have to build so that user can upload prodict photo from their computer

I think I'll need to have a template form for adding a new product

Need to implement different product categories

There's prob more but that's about how much I can think of.
